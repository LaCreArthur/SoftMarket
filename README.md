# SoftMarket
A Web Development Class Project for my ILC Master degree at the University of Strasbourg.


The goal was to create a simple shopping website, with a dynamic basket.

The instructions were to integrate a web design image (. JPG) onto html/css files and then add some pure PHP and AJAX requests to make it works (with no frameworks but bootstrap).
